## Welcome to my completely pirated Jekyll site.

I am a graduate student in Animal Behavior at UC Davis, but I moonlight as a low-level nerd.

I haven't totally figured out what I'll be using this site for yet - right now, it's a useful little hub for links to myself elsewhere on the
internet, like on [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/in/myfanwyjohnston), [GitHub](http://github.com/Myfanwy), 
and [UC Davis](http://biotelemetry.ucdavis.edu/pages/bio_Johnston.asp).
